# ChronicKidneyDisease

In the project we aim at predicting whether a patient is suffering from a Chronic Kidney Disease.
The dataset was extracted and preprocessed from Kaggle. The CSV file is uploaded.
The dataset is split into training and test set where we use the training set to train our model and test set for verifying whether the trained model is giving a suitable output.
Feature Scaling is done on the features/independent variables in order to standardise the values into an acceptable range.
The model is trained using K-Nearest-Neighbors Classification.
